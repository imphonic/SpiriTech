# SpiriTech
SpiriTech is a monorepo containing four central Rapidfire technologies: the Paranormal Engine, the Solara Engine, Spectral UI, and Ectoplasm.

# Motivation
This technology was built for CONNIPTION: Paranoia, a survival-horror game heavily involving the paranormal. It is being developed with natural
graphics and supernatural performance in mind, as Paranoia (and CONNIPTION as a whole) must render high-fidelity graphics at high enough framerates
to support the skill-heavy, almost Soulslike combat, ensuring that every player has a fair chance no matter the hardware.

Originally, I was going to use Unreal Engine 5. I am still on track to release the game with UE5, though using a very dumbed-down version of
the engine that uses the Forward Renderer and almost none of its other features. Paranoia's aforementioned fast-paced gameplay simply doesn't
work well with an engine that can barely manage 30 FPS on high-end console hardware, leading me to develop this technology as a replacement.
