# Paranormal Engine
### "Natural Graphics, Supernatural Performance"

## About Paranormal
The Paranormal Engine is a proprietary game engine developed by Will Pimentel-Tonche of Rapidfire Computer
Entertainment. It is being created to address performance issues caused by Unreal Engine 5, the studio's engine
of choice since April 2022.

### CONNIPTION: Paranoia - the game warranting in-house technology
**CONNIPTION: Paranoia** is an upcoming survival-horror fighting game with Soulslike and fantasy elements that has been
in and out of development since December 2020. Its horror themes work best with photo-realistic graphics, but its
fast-paced gameplay and high level of difficulty necessitate high framerates and minimal input delay. The engine's
duty is to combine high fidelity and high performance, instead of choosing one or the other like competing engines.

### Goals
- 160 FPS @2560x1600 on PS5/XSX and PC users with an AMD Radeon 780M (GTX 1650) or better
- 60 FPS on Nintendo Switch and @1920x1200 for PC users with hardware from the Kepler/Maxwell days (circa 2013-2015)
- No graphics scalability options implemented or required
- Reusable for future games, the open-source community, and resumes (for college or jobs)
