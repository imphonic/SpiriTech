# Paranormal Engine
### "Natural Graphics, Supernatural Performance"
The Paranormal Engine is a game engine developed by Will Pimentel-Tonche of Rapidfire Computer
Entertainment. It is being created to address performance issues caused by Unreal Engine 5, the studio's engine
of choice since April 2022.

### CONNIPTION: Paranoia - the game warranting in-house technology
**CONNIPTION: Paranoia** is an upcoming survival-horror fighting game with Soulslike and fantasy elements that has been
in and out of development since December 2020. Unlike other survival-horror games, where the player shoots at or runs
away from enemies, Paranoia has the player punching, kicking, and using makeshift weapons to defeat foes.

At the moment, Paranoia's gameplay demo is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. Its horror themes work best with
photo-realistic graphics, which Unreal Engine excels with. However, Paranoia's fast-paced gameplay and high level of
difficulty necessitate high framerates and minimal input delay. This makes Unreal Engine, notorious for its performance
issues, unsuitable for final production. The engine's duty is to combine high fidelity and high performance, instead of
choosing one or the other like competing engines.

### Goals
- 160 FPS at 1920x1080 on all targets (yes, this is how extreme the performance demands are)
  - PlayStation 5
  - Xbox Series X
  - macOS with Apple Silicon
  - PCs with a GTX 1650 or better (headroom available for lower-end as far back as 2013)
  - **160 FPS provides comfortable headroom for 144Hz monitors/TVs and 8000Hz polling-rate input devices**
- No graphics scalability options implemented or required
- Reusable for future games, the open-source community, and resumes (for college or jobs)
- Modular design permitting the engine's components to be reused in other custom engines for future titles,
if necessary (e.g. Project Cataclypsa, an engine for an unannounced RPG which may need even more performance)
